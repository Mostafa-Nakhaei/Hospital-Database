1) 	Technicans, Admin, Doctors, and Nurse are subset of employee set. 
	Employee has not been considered as a separate table to remove redundancy but each empolyee type were given emp_ID.	
	Also, the participation in the ER diagram is not total since hospital have many employee types (more than 4 mentioned types).

2) 	For doctors with admiting privileges a subset of all doctors was considered. This was done by making a subset table for Doctors

3)	For Patients, two subsets were considered one for inpatients and the other for outptients. 
	These two tables are connceted through table "Patients". Each patient (either in patient or out patient) recives an patient ID.
	emergency contact and insurance must be provided for each patient (NOT NULL constraint was enforced).

4)	Patients are connected to addmited_Patient table throuhgh patient ID as foregin key. 
	It is also connected to admin table by employee ID as forign key to keep of who discharge the patient.
	The general purpose for this table is to keep track of admission and discharge time for each patient.


5)	treatment was connceted to hospital_treatment_list to address the need for BCNF.


6)	In patients, doctors with admiting privileges, and treatment were connected by a ternary relation. 
	The main reason was to make sure patient's primary doctor is who perform treatments
